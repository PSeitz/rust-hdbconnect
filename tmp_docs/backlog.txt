- provide a function to explain the value of ServerError::code, based on information in 
  https://explore.me.sap.corp/orange/orange/ptime/common/tolerance/ptime_error_code.h.html and 
  https://explore.me.sap.corp/orange/orange/ptime/common/tolerance/ptime_error_code.cc.html

- Transaction Handling
    * transactionflags
        - has ids 0..6
        - test_prepare: reply is dropped, but not all parts were evaluated:
          part-kind = TransactionFlags

- StatementContext
    assumption: 
        should be handled generically, on low level; 
        is used to support automatic reconnects!

- Client Info:
    * (contains Application, ApplicationVersion, ApplicationSource, ApplicationUser)
    * add it to the conn_core
    * allow setting it in the connection API,
    * send it with execute_direct, prepare, execute

- distributed system
    - additional options in session_context
    - additional part CLIENTDISTRIBUTIONMODE

LOBs
    - add findlob and writelob and additional request-part LOBFLAGS

- avoid sending fetchsize always
- implement missing types
    - SECONDDATE
    - DAYDATE
    - SECONDTIME
    - SMALLDECIMAL  -> no docu found -> see sources?
- size/length/padding in argument ??
- allow setting the clientinfo stuff on the connection (or do it automatically?)
  and send it to the server whenever necessary/adequate
- evaluate tablelocation
